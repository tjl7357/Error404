Welcome to Documentation, this will explain most functions of most classes in alphabetical order


Collider.SetWidth - sets the width of the collider
Collider.SetHeight - sets the height of the collider
Collider.Intersects - checks to see if a collider is intersecting with another collider

CollisionManager.GetInstance - gives access to the CollisionManager
CollisionManager.GetInstance.AddStaticCollider - adds a collider that does not handle collisions
CollisionManager.GetInstance.AddActiveCollider - adds a collider that handles collisions, checking against all the static colliders
CollisionManager.GetInstance.CheckForCollisions - checks for collisions between active and static colliders.

Component.Draw - Called upon Component being Drawn
Component.OnCollision - Called when a gameobject collides with a collider
Component.Start - Called upon Component being added to a GameObject
Component.Update - Called upon Component being updated
Component.LateUpdate - Called upon Component being updated after collision is handled

GameObject.AddComponent - adds a component to the gameobject
GameObject.Draw - draws all the components of the gameobject
GameObject.GetComponent - gets a reference to the first available component of the gameobject
GameObject.HasComponent - informs you whether a component of type exists in the gameobject
GameObject.GetComponents - gets a reference to all the components of a type in the gameobject
GameObject.GetComponentCount - gets the number of components of a type in the gameobject
GameObject.LateUpdate - Updates all the components of the gameobject after collisions have been handled.
GameObject.OnCollision - sends a notice of a collision to all the gameobjects
GameObject.Update - updates all the components of the gameobject

ObjectManager.GetInstance - gives access to the ObjectManager
ObjectManager.GetInstance().AddObject - adds an gameobject to be managed
ObjectManager.GetInstance().Draw - draws all the gameobjects
ObjectManager.GetInstance().LateUpdate - updates all gameobjects after collision has been handled
ObjectManager.GetInstance().Update - updates all the gameobjects

TextureComponent.Draw - draws the texture component
TextureComponent.SetWidth - Sets the width of the textureComponent
TextureComponent.SetHeight - sets the height of the texturecomponent
